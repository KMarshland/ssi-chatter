# What is the client folder?

This is where simple code for testing the client for the SSI chatter server. Eventually this code will be moved over to
the main HABMC repository; this is just for rapid development.

# How do I run it?

Run `npm start`. Note that this is NOT started by docker like the server, as this code is not intended to run in 
production.
